## Features

### AI + Human Hybrid Mode
- Toggle AI on/off per conversation using a built-in toggle button
- When AI is enabled, it automatically sends emails to clients without manual intervention
- Any human agent can take over a conversation instantly — AI hands off cleanly
- AI responses are clearly tagged with an **AI** label in the chat UI

### Privacy-First Architecture
- Only the assigned agent can view and respond to their conversation thread
- Chat history is invisible to other agents — complete session isolation
- No cross-agent data leakage across concurrent active sessions

### Client Listing & Chat UI
- A new client entry is automatically created when a conversation is started
- WhatsApp-style scrollable chat interface with full message history
- AI and human messages are visually differentiated with labels

### Bulk Email Support
- Send to 100+ recipients simultaneously
- All outbound emails are sent from your authenticated Google account

### Gmail API Integration
- Login with your personal or company Google account
- All emails sent and received are routed through your authenticated Gmail account

### Flexible LLM Support
- Powered by Groq API out of the box
- Architected to swap to any other LLM provider with minimal code changes
- AI is prompt-engineered to respond in a consistent, professional tone

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.26+
- A Google account with Gmail API enabled
- A Groq API key (or any other LLM provider key)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Goofy-elf1/MailFlow.git
cd MailFlow
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
```

`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` are also accepted for compatibility.

### 4. Enable Gmail API

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable the **Gmail API**
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Add your redirect URI

For local testing, add the exact localhost callback you use, such as:

```text
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

If you run on another local port, add that exact callback too, for example `http://localhost:5300/auth/callback`.

### 5. Run the app

```bash
go run ./backend
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Switching LLM Providers

MailFlow uses Groq by default but is built to be provider-agnostic. To switch providers:

1. Replace the Groq client initialization in `backend/` with your preferred provider's SDK
2. Update your `.env` with the new API key
3. Adjust the model name in the AI config

Tested providers: Groq (Llama 3). Compatible with: OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and any OpenAI-compatible API.

---

## Deployment

MailFlow can be deployed on [Render](https://render.com) as a Web Service.

1. Create a new **Web Service** and connect your repo
2. Set **Build Command** to `go build -o server ./backend`
3. Set **Start Command** to `./server`
4. Add your environment variables (`APP_ENV=production`, `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID`, `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `FROM_NAME`) in the Render dashboard
5. Add your Render callback URL (`https://<your-app>.onrender.com/auth/callback`) to Google Cloud Console authorized redirect URIs

---

## How It Works

1. **Login** with your Google account — all emails are sent from this address
2. **Start a conversation** — a client entry is created automatically
3. **Toggle AI mode** — AI handles replies automatically when enabled
4. **Take over anytime** — click the toggle to switch to human mode and respond manually
5. **Bulk send** — use the bulk mail option to reach 100+ clients at once
